â€‹	Social networks were a key factor of the transformation that took place in the City of God.  This was highlighted in the film that was released in 2002. The film established this through showing the development of children throughout the movie in the favela near Rio de Janerio.  It first showed the boys growing up with an older group of boys being petty criminals, shown by them hitting a gas truck. One of them with a brother named Rocket who actually had a chance with school to get out of the slum.  Another boy named Benny who was friends with both Rocket and that of Lil'Dice (later to be named Lil Ze).  

Growing up these boys were emerged into a life of poverty, drugs, and crime.  When they became to the rank of teenagers their lives went in all different directions.  Rocket wanted to achieve his dream of becoming a photographer, Lil Ze wanted to  be the most notorious hood in the City of God, while Benny was Lil Ze right hand man that had a soul for others.   It could be seen throughout the the movie how these three boys paths always seemed to cross. Such as Rocket casually walking around and always running into Lil Ze who he did not care for much.  The social network of the gang/criminal network that they had created was also very prominent as how it had its own order that was like a pyramid until you reached that of Lil Ze running the drugs.  Also a huge role of in the movie is that of the police. In one seen they gunned down a kid that turned out not to be a hood and instead took his dead body's hand and shot a gun to "justify" their actions, or that or Lil Ze paying the police off and allowing him to be let go. The gang war towards the end of the movie shows that of two complex system of Carrot and Ned versus Lil Ze. This showed the extent of what crime would reach through that of group pressure. Recruiting anyone whos hand would fit a gun in it in order to have soldiers for their cause. Also another very prominent network was that of the little children or Runts. 

Scale plays a huge role in this development of the city.  Looking at the favela or slum, government project that was created to be a "perfect" place to hide the hoodlums from the city.  It is seen the governments plan fails badly.  Through this change you see the scaling of how the cities complex system changes.  First from a sort of corrupted city to that of all out corruption and full on gang warzone.   It can be seen how that of a bigger city allows for higher social activity, which could allow for positive networks and institutions to flourish but could also result in that of huge problems such as those modeled in the movies story of development.  Scale could be seen in the city also by that of the hierarchal organization in that of gangs and how far that spread could reach.   It could be seen in the scene of the movie where they broke down the how the business was run from the bottom of the bottom to the top with king pins.  Also could be seen with Rocket working as a newspaper boy to be able to climb the ladder to hopefully become a photographer.   Another aspect is that of the  apartment that the business was run out of and how almost could be compared to that of humans circulatory system.  In how that was the heart of the business that had branches of the business off that reached out that go smaller and smaller as they went.  I believe the number of links between people grew faster then the movie showed.  You would have to think about who they sold drugs to each day and how links were automatically created. 

Tobler's First Law of Geography ties in perfectly of that of the development that the movie shows.   I think it could be shown in that of the relationship of Lil'Ze and Rocket.  Rocket didn't want to be connected to him at all but he didn't have a choice just do to how the complex system of networks in the slums were modeled.   Most people didn't have a choice and were dragged into a predestined life just because of the location and networks that they grew up in.  The phrase "se correr o bicho pega, se ficar o bicho come" could be found to be true with evidence of Shaggy being shot while trying to escape or through Benny just wanted to leave and fate leading to him being shot.  Rocket could even be said to fit into that saying with how he kept his distance as much as possible but Lil'Ze made him take photos of his gang.  Rocket was able to escape the beast though.  He lived his life scared of the beast (Lil'Ze) and thought that he was gonna be killed for him being posted in the newspaper but was lucky.  Being able to stay out of the life of crime of murder and drug running, he was one of probably few to be able to get out, another example of someone escaping would be that of the film developer at the newspaper that was able to help Rocket out. 

To summarize, the slums of that was the City of God showed the ironic name by how much corruption and crime took place there.  The city could be looked at through the lens of scale to be able to to see how the interaction of networks and individuals could be modeled.  Finally it could be seen just how hard it was to get out of the self fulfilling prophecy of becoming a hood and most likely dying a hood compared to being able to make it out of the slum.  The City of God could of really could of used that of development principles to be used by the government to be able to end the cycle that became an inhabitant of the slums.
