​      The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the leading cause of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa. HIV is also one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even with recent increases in antiretroviral therapy (ART), a lifelong treatment that has been successful at managed the disease, 60% of eastern and central Africans with HIV are not receiving treatment. Thus, showing how this is a huge healthcare problem with a need to allocate resources where they are needed the most. The Sustainable Development Goal 3 states the goal of “Ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” Thus, this HIV epidemic can be a focus of succeeding in this goal. In route to solve this goal they use the method of disease burden estimation to allow for the allocation of resources to allow for human development. Through the lenses of Amartya Sen’s view of human development, he says that it is the enhancement of freedoms to lead lives people have a reason to value. This is applicable to how the HIV epidemic leads people to live lives with limited freedoms and a lower value of life. 

​      Using data from the 134 surveys in 41 countries, clinical data, and micro census they were able to adapt and use machine learning estimated information, to put together a 5km x 5km map to give a geospatial view of the prevalence of HIV in the Sub-Saharan Africa region.  These surveys having Global Position System coordinates that allows for easier graphing. These maps developed using Carto, which is an easy to use GIS software in raster files. This data also being generated to show first subdivisions of countries and second subdivision data.  Thus, this is a bottom up approach of trying to use small datasets combined with geospatial data to . This could be used in my research to show how data can be manipulated into an easily to read format to show the burden of HIV in the Sub-Saharan region. 

​      The data map series reveal a huge discrepancy. The more developed southern countries, such as South Africa show an extremely high prevalence of HIV. While countries that as less developed such as Democratic Republic of the Congo show a low prevalence of HIV. This could be attributed to the lack of available and accurate data collected within these countries.  The researchers did a good job of including an uncertainty map to show where lack of information may occur. This could be added to with my research because it shows how they can be shortages of information on both data gathered on the ground and how it can lead to misinformation.

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to the majority of HIV cases.  This is due to the lack of healthcare, contraceptives, and availability to treatment.  This looks article looks to fulfill The Sustainable Development Goal 3 also by promoting health with the goal of finding ways to ease the process of dispersion of health services.  In a study to figure out the extent of the use of GIS and spatial analysis, researchers went through and looked at all the articles posted about the use of HIV.  As GIS is new tool that is quickly being implemented to be able to solve problems. 

**Quote:**  "Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis are emerging tools for global health, but it is unclear to what extent they have been applied to HIV research in Africa."  

Thus the researchers are trying to figure out how GIS has been applied to the situation to be able combat the disease. (Boyda et al., 2019)

**Quote:** "GIS tools were regularly used to display HIV prevalence, incidence or mortality data in order to communicate complex information about the epidemic in a clear and accessible way." (Boyda et al., 2019)

This quote can be used to show how GIS tools allow for presenting the data in a clear and easy way to allow for better understanding of the complex situation.  Simplified information can allow for easier allocation of resources and services to be able to enable for easier 

**Quote: **"This systematic review searched for and summarized evidence on the use of GIS and spatial analysis techniques for HIV in Africa. Our findings demonstrate the wide array of spatial approaches to HIV-related data. These applications include characterizing geographic distribution of HIV, evaluating HIV epidemiologic risk factors, and assessing and improving implementation of HIV services. The rapid growth and diversity of applications of GIS and spatial analysis to the field of HIV yields great potential for future insights and progress." (Boyda et al., 2019)

GIS data has been used for 3 main reasons,  thus for characterizing geographic distribution of HIV, evaluating HIV epidemiologic risk factors, and assessing and improving implementation.  The use of GIS for looking at the distribution of HIV is an example of how GIS is able to help show the burden of disease across geographic locations.  It also is able to be used for precision epidemiology as it can be used for looking at risk factors, as well providing better information on implementing HIV services and resources in critical locations.   Using data that is already available and then using processing like top-down, or bottom-up processing with machine learning allows for easier, faster, and cost effective way to combat HIV and other epidemics.

 **Quote: **"Under the premise that in a resource-constrained environment such as Sub-Saharan Africa it is not possible to do everything, to everyone, everywhere, detailed geographical knowledge about the HIV epidemic becomes essential to tailor programmatic responses to specific local needs." (Cuadros et.al, 2017)

The quote mentions how Sub-Saharan Africa is a resource constrained area.  Those mentioning how most of it is not developing or in the process of developing.  With the states that a lot of the countries are in right now, it makes it hard for government or researchers to gather information in a uniform fashion.  Thus showing how much they have to rely on geospatial data and bottom-up processing to be able to fill gaps that they are missing.  This can be used to show how data science and machine learning are necessary for this process of development. 

**Quote: **"The main source of data for our study was the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). We focused our evaluation to countries located at the eastern part of SSA, where the prevalence of HIV is high and there is substantial spatial variability of HIV prevalence within countries"(Cuadros et.al, 2017)

They are using information from the DHS from Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania. With all but Kenya named as a low-income country.  Among these countries researchers looked at different information form the surveys that included socioeconomic status, demographics, and biological variables that showed spatial distribution of HIV.

Using the different variables including in the data gathered through surveys and the DHS data, they computed model maps of the prevalence of HIV in the three countries.  The models allowed for a rich and complex geographical variation of the HIV epidemic in each country.  This is returned allowed for an easier analysis of the datasets provided to them.   It could be seen in the areas where they were higher population density that HIV prevalence was also higher compared to lower population dense areas.  These areas of high prevalence cluster are referred to as hot spots.  Through the research it was found that the high-prevalence areas were skewed and supported very high prevalence values.   

Even though this maps produced between geospatial data being combined with machine learning with datasets allows for good models of the HIV epidemic, there are a lot of unknowns.  The data that they collect is limited due to the limitation.  Higher at risk population such as female sex workers, drug users, and homosexual men could have been missed by the surveys.

**Quote: **"In this article we draw on the power of geographic information systems (GIS) to examine the progression of HIV/AIDS in Africa for the period from 1986 to 2003. We use GIS for two purposes: (1) to transform and interpolate a set of annual point-based HIV/AIDS rates into area data; and (2) to extract or “mine” annual HIV/AIDS prevalence rates from the interpolated area (country) level maps. Once the rates are extracted from the GIS analysis we then model and forecast them into the near future (i.e., 2004–2010) by using the UNAIDS Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) software" (Kalipeni et al., 2008)

Researchers use this software called Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) to be able to look at data and incomplete data.  The software allows for a forecast of in a geospatial wat to be able to look at how HIV distribution will look in the future. 

Using this data for the purpose of meeting the sustainable development goal 3,  researchers are using it to be able to estimate burden of the disease, as well as for use for epidemiology.  This article is helping with trying to use GIS and software to allow for the expansion of freedoms of a happy and healthy life. 

The article also mentions the use of GIS and Datasets for HIV to be used with caution.  Caution because of the limitation that the data may actually cover.  This considered in the following quote. 

**Quote: **"Thus if 500 pregnant women visiting a clinic in a given year were tested for HIV and 150 of them tested positive for the virus, the rate for all adults attending that clinic would be recorded as 30 percent"(Kalipeni et al., 2008)

Even sources that are of higher quality still sometimes do not provided the full picture.  Given a Statistic from a sample compared to a parameter means you need to look at what the sample is actually measuring.  As data in countries such as Sub-Saharan Africa region being less developed with less government collected data makes  it hard to have an accurate estimation of the burden of HIV.  This can be used in my research to show the yellow tape that is there is with trusting in datasets and with machine learning.   Also touches back to the idea of a humbler data science.  Human development needs to also get feet on the ground to allow for more accurate data to be used in the process.  This can be used in my problem statement to help show how this is a problem in the use of data science on battling HIV. 

In this research they used both raster and vector maps to display data in an easier procedure.   They also compare to major processing techniques.  (1) The Inverse Distanced Weighted Algorithm (IDW), with projects more influence on areas closer to it compared to areas that are farther in distance.  (2) is the Kriging method which instead uses mathematical models based on distance decay to predict unmeasured areas.  The IDW showed better predictive power then the kriging method.  Could use this information in my research to show the algorithm that are used to generate results with such data.

In the Journal Article they look at how the use of geospatial software is reliant on the data that is fed to it.  Their a lot of problems that arrive from this such as many things.

"Demographic data come from different sources: censuses, civil registration systems, governmental or non-governmental administrative data or sample surveys. Civil registration systems provide the most reliable and useful demographic data as they continuously record information on the population of a country, including their spatial distribution. However, up-to-date registration systems only exist in a small number of countries. Instead, censuses are conducted approximately every 10 years by national statistical offices in order to provide consistent and geo-referenced population data. The accuracy and amount of data supplied by national censuses vary considerably from one country to the other. From a temporal point of view, (at the time of writing) the most recent census is more than 25 years old in some sub-Saharan countries such as Angola, Eritrea and the Demographic Republic of Congo" (Linard et al., 2012)

This whole quote is perfect to help add support to my problem statement about the differences in quality of data between countries. The Congo is a prime example to show the lack of accurate data compared to that of a more developed country.  

With more up to date data, there would be in increase in human development due to the increase of freedom of life, and health.   This article is broad in the subject matter of dimension of human development  and more focused on how that of newer data would allow for better allocation of resources for disease control.   This is focused towards the sustainability goal 3 to ensure long and healthy lives.  The article focuses 

 **Quote: **"Population movements also make counts not entirely representative of the long-term residential population. However, censuses are often the only consistent and exhaustive population databases available in countries where registration systems do not exist, and quantifying such uncertainties remains difficult."(Linard et al., 2012)  

This quote goes into another way that information can be skewed leading to difficulties in inputting uncertain data into models.  It is also very important to notice that the low-income regions are the highest at risk, so the low quality of data in that region is not very helpful.  This can be used in my research proposal to be able to state that feet are needed on the ground to, to be able to solve this problem.
