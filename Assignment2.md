**Introduction:**

The purpose of this research is to advance the use of geographic information system (GIS) mapping to produce a burden of disease map by estimating and validating the use of Inverse Distance Method Algorithm (IDW) compared to the use of Kriging method.  To achieve this research goal of allowing for more accurate models will increase the effectiveness of combating the spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  I will achieve this goal through the following objectives. 

1. Use estimate the burden of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) across the Sub-Saharan Africa. 

2. Use of a GIS to created map of Sub-Saharan Africa to be able to allocate resources and enhanced the precision epidemiology. 

This will build on the work by ........... and will incorporate 

**Human Development Topic:**

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the leading cause of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa with 28.5 million people living with HIV as of 2006 (Mboup et. al, 2006).  As a leading cause of morbidity and mortality it has turned into an epidemic. With machine learning techniques epidemiologist has been able to take an technological advanced method to combat this problem. Yet, lack of data in low income and developing countries in Sub-Sahara Africa, can create gaps and problems for the allocation of resources. More productive way to allocate resources would enhancement of human capabilities, such as peoples health which in return would allow for the capabilities to be used for opportunities such as a better jobs.  This can be shown as the enhancement of freedoms that are stripped by HIV such as the freedom to have a healthy life.  With this research is on the premise of trying to achieve sustainability development goal 3 of promoting good health and well being. 

**Human Development Process:**

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has a huge presence in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Sub-Saharan has networks just like that of other countries based on the sexual networks and social networks that people maintain.  With the highest rates of HIV spreading occurring from either sexual intercourse, through childbirth, and through the sharing of needles (such as through the use of drugs).  These social networks allow for transmission of HIV rapidly through areas with poor healthcare system, sexual education, and high rates of drug use.  These factors identify how HIV could be a huge burden in the less developed countries and regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In low developed areas the deficit of social services cause for a higher chance for disease and like HIV.  

Development of the situation started with trying to find a way to cure and/or treat HIV and stopping the spread of disease.  The process got first addressed through the steps of sexual education to stop the spread, in location that had the resources to to hold courses.  Next there was the development of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is a lifelong treatment has been successful at managing the disease.  The problem that arises from it is that only about 40% of eastern and central Africans (a good portion of Sub-Saharan Africa) actually receive treatment (Dwyer-Lindgren, 2019).  This is due to the poverty that leads to limited access to good healthcare.  Crucial things such as test for HIV, antiretroviral therapy, and knowledge about safe sex practices.   Usually in areas of higher population   density there consists of more social networks, which in return allows for an enabler for HIV to strive.  This can be shown to be hot spots for HIV and areas where less density appears can be associated with lower rates of HIV to be cold spots.
