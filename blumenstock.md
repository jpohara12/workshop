## What is the promise of data science for human development?

  The Promise of the use of data science to help with human development is that of easier idenification of needs and better allocation mechanism then before.  Those such as the example of international telephone calls helping idenitify areas of lower econonmic status or thus of roofs of houses from sattellite maps.  This showing how big data can save organizations and goverenments both time and resources using the more modernized way of idenifiying a problem. 
  
## What are the pitfalls mentioned in the article? 

  One pitfall is that of validity of the information gathered. An example is that of different cultures have different tendencies of communication.  Othe examples giving such as that of people finding ways around data collection to be able to benfit from the aid given out. Another pitfall is that of regualtion of big data.  Different governments set different regualtation on the public acesss of ones data due to priracy concerned.  This such as it could be unethical to use peoples data.  Another pitfall is that some of the people that need help the most are the ones you will not be able to find data on.  Such as a family that could not afford to have cell phones.
  
## What are the ways fowarded?  

  The ways foward are that of looking for ways to fix the pitfalls. This includes finding ways to be able to validate data collected instead of getting to far ahead of themselves in this data collection and data analzye.  Such as taking in more variables that could peoples resouorces that allow for data collection or how transparnt these studies are.  Another way foward is that of not being to intriguted by the profit and greed coming along with these innovations, and to be more focused on learning more about these probelems and  context of the sitaution better. 
  
## Intent, Transparency, and Balancing act
 
 The idea of data science to promote human development is such a promising idea yet, there are many problems that arise from it.  The intent of a data scientist trying to anazlye a situation is most likely for the gains of others but you have to think of how this process may affect others. How do we determine who is really most in need? Transparency is also a huge issue that could be resolved.  Everyone is concerned about how ones data may be used agaisnt them and/or invade their privacy and not how it may help them. This beign a problem with how theres not clear communication of how data is being used to inform people.  This is vice versa though.  As promising as data science is in this cause, there still needs to be human interaction and informed information about needs. 
 
### Big Data 
 
 Big Data are extremely large data sets that may be analzyed to find trends and patterns. Example would be such as Cell Detail Records.  These can help make both static and dyanmic mapping of data. Example global imaging, such as using GPS systems. 
 
### Machine Learning 
 
 Machine learning is that machines use algorithmas and statisitical models to peform task without explicitied insturuction and having to make infrences. 

### Human Development 

Human development is the growth of oppurtunities and allowing for a better well-being.
