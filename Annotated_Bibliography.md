Dwyer-Lindgren, L., Cork, M.A., Sligar, A. et al. Mapping HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2017. Nature 570, 189–193 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1200-9 

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the leading cause of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa.  HIV is also one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even with recent increases in antiretroviral therapy (ART), a lifelong treatment that has been successful at managed the disease, 60% of eastern and central Africans with HIV are not receiving treatment. Thus, showing how this is a huge healthcare problem with a need to allocate resources where they are needed the most.  The Sustainable Development Goal 3 states the goal of “Ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.”  Thus, this HIV epidemic can be a focus of succeeding in this goal. In route to solve this goal they use the method of disease burden estimation to allow for the allocation of resources to allow for human development. Through the lenses of Amartya Sen’s view of human development, he says that it is the enhancement of freedoms to lead lives people have a reason to value. This is applicable to how the HIV epidemic leads people to live lives with limited freedoms and a lower value of life.  
 
 Using data from the 134 surveys in 41 countries and clinical data, they were able to adapt and use machine learning estimated information, to put together a 5km x 5km map to give a geospatial view of the prevalence of HIV in the Sub-Saharan Africa region.  These surveys having Global Position System coordinates that allows for easier graphing.  These maps developed using Carto, which is an easy to use GIS software in raster files. This data also being generated to show first subdivisions of countries and second subdivision data.  This could be used in my research to show how data can be manipulated into an easily to read format to show the burden of HIV in the Sub-Saharan region. 
	
  The data map series reveal a huge discrepancy. The more developed southern countries, such as South Africa show an extremely high prevalence of HIV.  While countries that as less developed such as Democratic Republic of the Congo show a low prevalence of HIV.  This could be attributed to the lack of available and accurate data collected within these countries.   The researchers did a good job of including an uncertainty map to show where lack of information may occur. This could be added to with my research because it shows how they can be shortages of information on both data gathered on the ground and how it can lead to misinformation.
