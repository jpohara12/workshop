## Formal Assignment

1. [Annotated Bibliography](https://jpohara12.github.io/workshop/Assignment1)

- Problem Statement:  
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the leading cause of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa.  As a leading cause of morbidity and mortality it has turned into an epidemic. With machine learning techniques epidemiologist has been able to take an technological advanced method to combat this problem. Yet, lack of data in low income and developing countries in Sub-Sahara Africa, can create gaps and problems for the allocation of resources. 

    - Harms: 
                High Rates of Morbility and Mortality  
  
    
    - Sub-Saharan Africa 
  
  
      - Precision Epidemiology and disease burdern estimation
  
  
2. [Literature Review ](https://jpohara12.github.io/workshop/Assignment2)


        - Gaps: Gaps include that of large areas of uncertainity, and low amounts of data on high risk social groups


3. [Methodology Investigation](https://jpohara12.github.io/workshop/Assignment3)


        - Methods: 
            - Inverse Distance Weighted Algorithm 
            - Bayesian Method


4. [Research Proposal](https://jpohara.github.io/workshop/FinalPaper) 


        -Research Question: “How can further improved geospatial data science methods be applied in research of HIV burden in sub-Saharan Africa?” 
        
                  1. How can modifying pre existing methods to be able to to account for high transmission groups?  
                  2a. What ways can updated and more accurate be collected to account for high transmission social groups?  
                  2b. What ways will allow for updated and more accurate data on areas with higher uncertainty?
