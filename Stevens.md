z**The authorsâ€™ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?**

It allows for easier analyze of the human population across these Low Income  Countries.  With knowing where the human population is it allows data  scientist to be able to have their methods be able to obtain better estimates of various kinds.  This allows for human development to be enhanced with the more approximate estimates that  allow for things such as better allocation of medical resources or for that of government aid. 

**Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?**

It allows for methods to be validated and modified to allow for better results of finding the burden of disease.  This could be shown by not of having accurate census data in the study of HIV burden but knowledge of human and households allow for methods such as the IDW to be able to obtain a more approximate estimation across Sub-Saharan Africa. 

**The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?**

Machine learning is designed to be able to use patterns and inference, while classical statistical methods are designed to make inferences only based off of relationships of variables .  A machine learning algorithm is a program that uses both math and logic that is able to learn over time how to perform better through processing data.
